# Reformulation of LBP through Convolutional Filters

In  (Juefei-Xu  et  al.,  2016),  the  author  demonstrates that it is possible to reformulate the LBP through convolutional filters.

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook shows step by step, the process of building a Reformulation of LBP through Convolutional Filters in Python using the TensorFlow framework.

## Dependencies

- PIL
- os
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tensorflow

You can install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ "pip"). And install TensorFlow via [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ "TensorFlow") link.

## Usage

1. Install the dependencies;
2. Run Jupyter Notebook in terminal to see the code in your browser.
